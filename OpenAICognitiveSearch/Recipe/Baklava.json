	"ingredients": [
		"1 lb phyllo dough",
		"1 lb unsalted butter, melted",
		"2 cups finely chopped walnuts",
		"2 cups finely chopped pistachios",
		"1 cup granulated sugar",
		"1 tablespoon ground cinnamon",
		"1/2 teaspoon ground cloves",
		"1 cup water",
		"1 cup honey",
		"1 tablespoon lemon juice"
	],
	"instructions": [
		"Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.",
		"In a medium bowl, combine the chopped walnuts, pistachios, sugar, cinnamon, and ground cloves. Mix well and set aside.",
		"Unroll the phyllo dough and place a damp cloth over it to prevent drying out.",
		"Place one sheet of phyllo dough into the baking dish and brush it generously with melted butter. Repeat this step with 7 more sheets, brushing each layer with butter.",
		"Sprinkle a generous amount of the nut mixture over the buttered phyllo layers.",
		"Continue layering phyllo sheets and brushing with butter between each layer, alternating with layers of the nut mixture, until all the nut mixture is used. Reserve a few sheets of phyllo for the top layer.",
		"Place the reserved sheets of phyllo on top, brushing each layer with butter.",
		"Using a sharp knife, cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes.",
		"Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until the baklava turns golden brown and crispy.",
		"While the baklava is baking, prepare the syrup by combining water, honey, and lemon juice in a saucepan. Bring it to a boil and then simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let it cool.",
		"Once the baklava is cooked, remove it from the oven and immediately pour the cooled syrup over the hot baklava, ensuring it seeps into all the cuts.",
		"Allow the baklava to cool completely in the dish before serving. This will allow it to soak up the syrup and develop its signature sticky texture.",
		"Serve at room temperature and enjoy!"
